Phase1 (#1~#20): 
- Definition of matrix LED lighting patterns as NFT using pseudo-random numbers
- Building devices as execution environments

Phase2 (#21~#70): 
- Definition of matrix LEDs lighting patterns as NFT with the contract address as random seed
- Prepare execution environments as mass production device

Phase3 (#71~?): 
- NFT of electrical and mechanical behavior (not limited to LED patterns)
